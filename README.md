Melo-mania website

A visually appealing website created using just HTML and CSS, which offers curated music suggestions: my top picks pertaining to various moods, genres and even languages.
The number of songs picked is minimum, to keep a simple approach to the site. Also, each song mention contains a link to the corresponding youtube video, where you can enjoy the music.
